  ## Description
  This is a project using mysql2, sequelize and express.js to create an API and connect it to a mysql database. 
  ## Installation
  To install this project, being by cloning the repo to your local harddrive. Then, you'll need to install dependencies for this project using 'npm install' at the root directory of your files. From there, launch mysql2 by typing 'mysql -u root -p'. Once mysql is running, seed the database schema by running 'source db/schema.sql'. After that, exit or open another instance of terminal, and at the root of the directory run 'npm run seed' to seed the database with all the data.
  ## Usage
  To test that the API is functioning, a server connection must be running using 'npm start'. Then, using Postman, or Insomnia Core (this tutorial uses Insomnia) you can check the Get/Post/Put/ Delete routes by typing in the correct PORT (3001) after your localhost, and checking each categories specific route (ex: localhost:3001/api/products to check all products)<br>
